    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class and Method Definition:**\n",
    "   - The `Solution` class is defined with a method `minSubArrayLen`.\n",
    "   - The method takes two parameters: `target` (the target sum) and `nums` (the list of integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        if not nums:\n",
    "            return 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edge Case Handling:**\n",
    "   - If the input list `nums` is empty, there are no subarrays, so the function returns 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        start, end = 0, 0\n",
    "        current_sum = nums[0]\n",
    "        min_length = float('inf')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `start` and `end` are pointers to the start and end of the current subarray.\n",
    "   - `current_sum` is the sum of the current subarray, initialized with the first element of `nums`.\n",
    "   - `min_length` is set to positive infinity initially, and it will be updated during the traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        while end < len(nums):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Main Loop:**\n",
    "   - The main loop iterates as long as the `end` pointer is within the bounds of the list `nums`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            if current_sum >= target:\n",
    "                min_length = min(min_length, end - start + 1)\n",
    "                current_sum -= nums[start]\n",
    "                start += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Subarray Sum Check:**\n",
    "   - If the sum of the current subarray is greater than or equal to the target:\n",
    "     - Update `min_length` with the minimum length found so far.\n",
    "     - Subtract the value at the `start` pointer from `current_sum` as we are moving the `start` pointer to the right.\n",
    "     - Increment the `start` pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                end += 1\n",
    "                if end < len(nums):\n",
    "                    current_sum += nums[end]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Expand Subarray:**\n",
    "   - If the sum is less than the target:\n",
    "     - Move the `end` pointer to the right to expand the subarray.\n",
    "     - Add the value at the new `end` position to `current_sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        return 0 if min_length == float('inf') else min_length\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Result:**\n",
    "   - If `min_length` remains as positive infinity, there was no subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the target. In that case, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the minimum subarray length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this algorithm uses a two-pointer approach to efficiently find the minimum length of a subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the target. It optimally updates the pointers and the sum while traversing the list once."
