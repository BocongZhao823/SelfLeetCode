    "## 2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each element of nums should be in exactly one array.\n",
    "- The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2\n",
    "- Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]\n",
    "- Explanation: We can divide the array into the following arrays: [1,1,3], [3,4,5] and [7,8,9].\n",
    "The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.\n",
    "- Note that the order of elements is not important.\n",

    "- Explanation: It is not possible to divide the array satisfying all the conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- n == nums.length\n",
    "- 1 <= n <= 105\n",
    "- n is a multiple of 3.\n",
