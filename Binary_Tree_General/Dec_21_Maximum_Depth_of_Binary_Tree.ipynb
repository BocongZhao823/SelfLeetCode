When calculating the depth of the right subtree of the root node 3, the recursive calls for the left subtree (node 15) and the right subtree (node 7) both return a depth of 0 (because they are leaf nodes with no children). The maximum depth between these two (max(0, 0) + 1) is 1. Therefore, the depth of the right subtree for the root node 3 is 1, and when you add 1 for the root node, you get a total depth of 2."

    "Exactly! The depth calculation is indeed a bottom-up process. The recursion starts from the leaf nodes, and as the recursive calls unwind (move back up the call stack), the depth is accumulated or computed for each level.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The recursion starts from the bottom (leaf nodes), where the depth is 0 (there are no child nodes).\n",
