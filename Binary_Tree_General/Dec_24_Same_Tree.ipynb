    "The `isSameTree` method is a recursive function that compares two binary trees `p` and `q`. The base cases are:\n",

    "1. If both `p` and `q` are `None`, it means the corresponding subtrees are the same, and the method returns `True`.\n",
    "2. If either `p` or `q` is `None` while the other is not, it means the trees are different, and the method returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the method compares the values of the current nodes `p.val` and `q.val`. If they are not equal, it means the trees are different, and the method returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the values are equal, the method recursively calls itself for the left and right subtrees of both trees (`p.left` with `q.left` and `p.right` with `q.right`). The recursive calls check the equality of nodes at each level of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the recursive calls for the given example:\n",

    "   - For the left subtree:\n",
