    "## Analysis Question \n",
    "\n",
    "The phrase \"Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values\" is a description of a problem related to binary tree traversal. Let's break down the components of this statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Tree:** A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Root of a Binary Tree:** The root is the topmost node in a binary tree, from which all other nodes are descended.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inorder Traversal:** Inorder traversal is one of the methods used to traverse a binary tree. In inorder traversal, you visit the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. For a binary search tree, the inorder traversal results in a sorted order of the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you're given the root of a binary tree and asked to return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values, it means you need to visit all the nodes in the binary tree following the inorder traversal strategy and collect the values of the nodes in the order they are visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you might implement this using a recursive function. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TreeNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n",

    "- `inorderRecursive(node.right, result)`: Recursively call the function on the right child of the current node. This step traverses the right subtree.\n",

    "# Printing the result\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output should be `[4, 2, 5, 1, 3]`, which represents the inorder traversal of the binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break down how the code works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We create a binary tree with the root having the value `1` and left and right children with values `2` and `3` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We create an instance of the `Solution` class: `solution = Solution()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We call the `inorderTraversal` method on this instance, passing the root of the binary tree as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside the `inorderTraversal` method, it initializes an empty list `result` to store the inorder traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It then calls the static method `inorderRecursive` with the root of the tree and the result list.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The `inorderRecursive` method is a recursive function that performs inorder traversal. It first checks if the current node is not `None`. If it's not `None`, it recursively calls itself for the left child, appends the current node's value to the result list, and then recursively calls itself for the right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The recursion continues until it reaches the leaf nodes. As it backtracks, it appends the values in the correct order to the result list.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Finally, the `result` list contains the inorder traversal of the binary tree, which is returned.\n",
    "\n",
