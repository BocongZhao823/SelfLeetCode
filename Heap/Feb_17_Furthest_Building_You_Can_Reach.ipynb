    "# 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.\n",
    "\n",
    "While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.\n",
    "- If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or `(h[i+1] - h[i])` bricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.\n",

    "**Explanation:** Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.\n",
    "- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.\n",
    "- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.\n",
    "- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.\n",
    "It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.\n",
