    "Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.\n",

    "Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).\n",

    "Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n",
    "   - Determine if a linked list has a cycle.\n",
    "   - The cycle can be detected by checking if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Approach:**\n",
    "   - Use two pointers, a slow pointer that moves one step at a time and a fast pointer that moves two steps at a time.\n",
    "   - If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up with the slow pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Input Handling:**\n",
    "   - Consider the constraints and handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Constraint:**\n",
    "   - The follow-up question asks if you can solve it using O(1) (constant) memory. This suggests that you should avoid using additional data structures like a set."

    "## Analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the corrected code line by line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class and Method Definition:**\n",
    "   - You define a class called `Solution` with a method `hasCycle`.\n",
    "   - The method takes `head` as an argument, which is the head of the linked list, and it returns a boolean indicating whether there is a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        if head is None:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Case Check:**\n",
    "   - If the linked list is empty (i.e., `head` is `None`), there can't be a cycle, so it returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        # If Linked List is not empty\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            slow = head\n",
    "            fast = head.next\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize Pointers:**\n",
    "   - If the linked list is not empty, initialize two pointers (`slow` and `fast`).\n",
    "   - `slow` starts at the head of the list.\n",
    "   - `fast` starts one step ahead of `slow` to create a speed difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Loop Condition:**\n",
    "   - The while loop continues until either `fast` or `fast.next` becomes `None`. This ensures that the loop breaks when the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "                if slow == fast:\n",
    "                    return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cycle Detection:**\n",
    "   - Inside the loop, check if the `slow` and `fast` pointers meet. If they do, it means there is a cycle, and the method returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "                slow = slow.next\n",
    "                fast = fast.next.next\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Update Pointers:**\n",
    "   - If no cycle is detected in the current iteration, update the pointers.\n",
    "   - Move `slow` one step forward and `fast` two steps forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **No Cycle Detected:**\n",
    "   - If the while loop completes without finding a cycle, the method returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach uses two pointers, where the fast pointer moves at twice the speed of the slow pointer. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. This algorithm ensures efficient cycle detection in a linked list.\n",
