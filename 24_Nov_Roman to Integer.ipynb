    "If there are totally **n** (e.g., = 5) Roman characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialise our totally count amount to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Split into 2 situations: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** when the Roman character locates at the (n-1)th position *--> The last Roman character's position* \n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** When the Roman character locates before the (n-1)th position --> *Before the last Roman character's position** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1**: Reason why we treat \"(n-1)th\" as the last character's position:   * We count 0 as the 1st position, thus, if n=5, the last character locates at n-1 = 5-1 = 4th position, NOT the n = 5th position.* \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2**: Reason why split \"position<n-1\" & \"postion==n-1\" situation  * We have to consider when we are not writing characters largest to smallest from left to right.  For example, if the ith character is 'I' and (i+ 1)th character is 'V'.  * The last character's position (n-1) does not have any more characters next to it. (It would out of index!). Thus, It could be discuss individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the 1st situation, the first n-1 (i.e., 5 - 1 = 4) Roman characters could be checked with its next Roman characters based on the rule in the question description. For example, if the ith Roman character is 'I', its next (ie., i+1 th ) character is 'V' or 'X', then we should delete 1 from totally count. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the 2nd situation, we don't need to do any check, all Roman characters should be accumalte to the total count. "
